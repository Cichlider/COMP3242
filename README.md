# COMP3242/6242: Deep Learning

Welcome to my repository for **COMP3242/6242: Deep Learning** at the Australian National University (ANU), Semester 1, 2026.

This repository contains my weekly laboratory implementations, programming tasks, and project materials focusing on the theory and practice of modern artificial neural networks.

## 📖 Course Overview

This course explores the foundational mathematics and practical applications of deep learning. Key topics include Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), Back-propagation, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Transformers, and Generative Models. These techniques are applied to solve realistic problems in computer vision, natural language processing, and generative AI using **Python** and **PyTorch**.
